# Copyright Renewals Search

## Background

For books published between 1923 through 1977, the copyright status depends on whether the copyright was renewed or not. Determination of the copyright status of these books thus requires a search of the renewal records. Unfortunately, the renewal records were all on paper. Digital scans of these records were made, and are available, but searching these scans is not easy.

New York Public Library has hired a contractor to take the scanned renewal records and convert them into well-structured XML data. The first tranche of 40,000 pages have now been converted, but there is a need for a user-friendly search interface for librarians, archivists, and rights researchers to make use of the XML data.

## Plan

This project will produce a user-friendly, open-source search interface for the structured renewal records.

The team will:

 - become familiar with the structure of the data. Over the years, the renewal records used four different formats, so the system will need to deal with four different data structures.
 - interview potential users to understand use cases and extract work flows and features sets for the search system.
 - identify appropriate search, application, web-service and user interface software for implementation of the search system.
 - implement and deploy the system.
 - user-test the system
