# capstone-projects
This repo is used to organize Free Ebook Foundation projects for Stevens Institute of Technology Senior-year computer science capstone projects.

## 2023-2024

Proposed project:

- [AI for Accessible Alt-text](alt-text.md)

Students interested in this project should use Github issues and pull requests to develop and propose teams. For example, students interested in a project but needing team members, and teams needing additional members should create an issue describing their interest and needs. Use issues to ask questions or seek clarification about the projects. To propose a team for a specific project, create a pull request adding the names of team members to the project page. You may also want to include roles, capabilities and the approach of the team. 

We will not accept a proposal PR until September 14. But do not wait until then to start a pull request even if your team is incomplete or you're still deciding - we will comment on PRs with the goal of improving them, and you can close the PR to withdraw the proposal. It is possible that this project coud be divided for two teams to work on.

I expect to meet with teams weekly via zoom and at least once in person - We will use Slack for meetings and discussions.
