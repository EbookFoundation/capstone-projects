# capstone-projects
This repo is used to organize Free Ebook Foundation projects for Stevens Institute of Technology Senior-year computer science capstone projects.

## 2019-2020

Proposed project:

 - [Project Gutenberg in a Box](pgiab.md)


Students interested in this project should use Github issues and pull requests to develop and propose teams. For example, students interested in a project but needing team members, and teams needing additional members should create an issue describing their interest and needs. Use issues to ask questions or seek clarification about the projects. To propose a team for a specific project, create a pull request adding the names of team members to the project page. You may also want to include roles, capabilities and the approach of the team. 

Since not all projects will be pitched until September 12, I will not accept a proposal PR until the end of September 13. But please do not wait until September 13 to start a pull request even if your team is incomplete or you're still deciding - I will comment on PRs with the goal of improving them, and you can close the PR to withdraw the proposal through September 13. If there are competing proposals, I will give preference to the best developed proposal. 

I expect to meet with teams weekly - I will use Slack for meetings and discussions. I think it's important to meet the team in person at least once, preferably multiple times over the course of a the school year.


## 2018-2019
