Mark Pipko - I have created a Node.js web application, hosted on a local express server, which allows users to simulate stock trading in real time, using MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, I have industry experience in programming Spring applications by using the Spring Boot framework in Java.   

Edward Yaroslavsky - I have experience with Node.js web development, routing, hosting servers, and REST APIs in order to work with full stack applications, alongside SQL and NoSQL data storing/querying. I have also worked with Azure DevOps and various AWS services to develop serverless applications.

We unanimously support the initiative to compile and organize free ebooks online. Our varying technical experience makes us a well-rounded team that accentuates each of our specialities. As Seniors, we’ve streamlined our collaborative processes over the course of countless prior projects together, and have established a reputation of success. We would love the chance to be able to leave our mark with The Free Ebook Foundation and further it’s reach.

Proposed project:

 - [Free-Programming-Books](fpb.md)



Students interested in this project should use Github issues and pull requests to develop and propose teams. For example, students interested in a project but needing team members, and teams needing additional members should create an issue describing their interest and needs. Use issues to ask questions or seek clarification about the projects. To propose a team for a specific project, create a pull request adding the names of team members to the project page. You may also want to include roles, capabilities and the approach of the team. 

I will not accept a proposal PR until September 16. But do not wait until then to start a pull request even if your team is incomplete or you're still deciding - I will comment on PRs with the goal of improving them, and you can close the PR to withdraw the proposal. If there are competing proposals, I will give preference to the best developed proposal. I am happy to schedule a Q&A session via Zoom- just request one via Github issues.

I expect to meet with teams weekly - I will use Slack for meetings and discussions. Ideally we'll be able to meet as a team in person, Covid permitting.
